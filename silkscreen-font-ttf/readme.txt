# What's the best way to use Silkscreen?
Silkscreen is best used in places where extremely small graphical display type is needed (duh!). The primary use is for navigational items (nav bars, menus, etc.). However, you can also use it for image captions and the like...wherever small type is needed. Silkscreen also works very well at large point sizes if you're looking for that chunky, old school computer look so popular with the kids today.

In order to preserve the proper spacing and letterforms, Silkscreen should be used at 8pt. multiples (8pt., 16pt., 24pt., etc.) with anti-aliasing turned off. For larger text (larger than 64pt.), you can use whatever size you want without too much of a problem.

Depending on which graphics program you are using with Silkscreen, you might have some problems with inconsistent letter spacing (this is not just a problem with Silkscreen, but with all fonts used at small sizes). To avoid those problems, you'll want to turn auto kerning and fractional widths (or any other sort of automatic letter spacing that your graphics program might use) off, and set the letter spacing or tracking to 0 or 0%. You'll know it's working properly when you have a 2 pixel space in between all of the letters.
